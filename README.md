# Midterm_Project
magnonics has the SINDy implementation on spins in 3D(mx,my,mz).
magnonics_2d has the 2d implementation, discarding r=1 to get the magnetisation in terms of (theta,phi)
pulse is the classical start to pulse programming, where the task is to minimize the switching time by using a pulse of Hext in a particular direction, (here x-direction) 
For more information about the methodology and inferences, read the midterm report and go through the presentation
